When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   When working on multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There maybe multiple users updating the remote repository. In order to focus on current task it would be necessary for the 
    current files to remain static.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

  forks are clones ON THE GITHUB. Clones are local copies and branches are local versions where changes are not meant to affect other branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  Can work on it with out internet. These maybe programs that cannot be conveniently modified on the GitHub server.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Exchange files. Harder to keep an account (time stamping). Easier to share files with someone with no knowledge of GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
