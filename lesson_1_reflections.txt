was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Every second counts. Can discover run-time error bugs that might be missed in testing. Certain versions that are deleted might turn out to be useful in the end.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  Certain files go hand in hand. Such as html file with the CSV file. So the files are logically linked to each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

  Knowing that I cna always go back to a previous version would elminate any concerns of breaking the software.
